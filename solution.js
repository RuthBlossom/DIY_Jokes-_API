// Uses the splice method to directly remove the joke from the original array.

// Pros:
// Modifies the original array, potentially saving memory for large datasets.

//Alternative Version to patch:

  //Pros:

    //Provides more explicit control over which fields are updated.
  //Clearly defines how the replacement values are determined.


  //Cons:

//May be considered slightly more verbose.(Verbose" refers to the use of more words or information than is necessary. In programming, it often refers to code that contains more lines or details than are strictly required to achieve a certain functionality.)
